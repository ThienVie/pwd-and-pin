# pwd-and-pin

Hi I am ThienViet. This is my first post in GitHub. I am really nervous so I try to explain so good as I can.

This is a password generator which I build for everyone.

Guides:
--------------------------------
1. You just need to install the package "[secrets](https://pypi.org/project/secrets/)".

Source or sauce:    https://pypi.org/project/secrets/

2. Run this option

3. Choose one of these options:    pin    password

Please, **avoid Password, passworD, paSSword, etc.**

* pin:      It will show "Your pin is: {random numbers}". The length of the numbers is automaticly four.

* password: You have the option to choose the length of the password. After that it will show

```
Your password is: {random uppercase, lowercase, digits and punctaution}
```
-------------------------------

**I am editing...**



I know I can do it better like typing the `try` function, but I will do it later.

This is the end of my explanation.

I wish you a happy day. :)
Bye.
